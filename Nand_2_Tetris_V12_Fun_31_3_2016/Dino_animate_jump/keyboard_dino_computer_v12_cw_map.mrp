Design Summary
--------------
Number of errors:      0
Number of warnings:   49
Logic Utilization:
  Number of Slice Flip Flops:           370 out of  17,344    2%
  Number of 4 input LUTs:             2,926 out of  17,344   16%
Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:          1,713 out of   8,672   19%
    Number of Slices containing only related logic:   1,713 out of   1,713 100%
    Number of Slices containing unrelated logic:          0 out of   1,713   0%
      *See NOTES below for an explanation of the effects of unrelated logic.
  Total Number of 4 input LUTs:       2,996 out of  17,344   17%
    Number used as logic:               876
    Number used as a route-thru:         70
    Number used for Dual Port RAMs:   2,048
      (Two LUTs used per Dual Port RAM)
    Number used as Shift registers:       2

  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.

  Number of bonded IOBs:                 16 out of     250    6%
    IOB Flip Flops:                       1
  Number of RAMB16s:                      9 out of      28   32%
  Number of BUFGMUXs:                     2 out of      24    8%

Average Fanout of Non-Clock Nets:                3.78

Peak Memory Usage:  345 MB
Total REAL time to MAP completion:  1 mins 3 secs 
Total CPU time to MAP completion:   1 mins

Section 4 - Removed Logic Summary
---------------------------------
1202 block(s) removed
 157 block(s) optimized away
2301 signal(s) removed

Section 5 - Removed Logic
-------------------------

The trimmed logic report below shows the logic removed from your design due to
sourceless or loadless signals, and VCC or ground connections.  If the removal
of a signal or symbol results in the subsequent removal of an additional signal
or symbol, the message explaining that second removal will be indented.  This
indentation will be repeated as a chain of related logic is removed.

To quickly locate the original cause for the removal of a chain of logic, look
above the place where that logic is listed in the trimming report, then locate
the lines that are least indented (begin at the leftmost edge).

Section 10 - Timing Report
--------------------------
A logic-level (pre-route) timing report can be generated by using Xilinx static
timing analysis tools, Timing Analyzer (GUI) or TRCE (command line), with the
mapped NCD and PCF files. Please note that this timing report will be generated
using estimated delay information. For accurate numbers, please generate a
timing report with the post Place and Route NCD file.

For more information about the Timing Analyzer, consult the Xilinx Timing
Analyzer Reference Manual; for more information about TRCE, consult the Xilinx
Command Line Tools User Guide "TRACE" chapter.
